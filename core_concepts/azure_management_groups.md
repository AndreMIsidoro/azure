# Azure management groups

Resources are gathered into resource groups, and resource groups are gathered into subscriptions.
Â 
If you have many subscriptions, you might need a way to efficiently manage access, policies, and compliance for those subscriptions. Azure management groups provide a level of scope above subscriptions. You organize subscriptions into containers called management groups and apply governance conditions to the management groups.
