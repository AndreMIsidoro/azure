### Cloud Computing

**Cloud computing** -  is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Because cloud computing uses the internet to deliver these services, it doesn’t have to be constrained by physical infrastructure the same way that a traditional datacenter is.

### Shared Responsibility Model

Physical security, power, cooling, and network connectivity are the responsibility of the cloud provider. At the same time, the consumer is responsible for the data and information stored in the cloud. The consumer is also responsible for access security, meaning you only give access to those who need it.

The shared responsibility model is heavily tied into the cloud service types: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS).

## Types of Clouds

### Private Cloud

It’s a cloud (delivering IT services over the internet) that’s used by a single entity.  Private cloud provides much greater control for the company and its IT department. However, it also comes with greater cost and fewer of the benefits of a public cloud deployment.

### Public Cloud

A public cloud is built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider. With a public cloud, anyone that wants to purchase cloud services can access and use resources. The general public availability is a key difference between public and private clouds.

### Hybrid Cloud

A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment. A hybrid cloud environment can be used to allow a private cloud to surge for increased, temporary demand by deploying public cloud resources. Hybrid cloud can be used to provide an extra layer of security. For example, users can flexibly choose which services to keep in public cloud and which to deploy to their private cloud infrastructure.

### Multi-Cloud

A fourth, and increasingly likely scenario is a multi-cloud scenario. In a multi-cloud scenario, you use multiple public cloud providers.
