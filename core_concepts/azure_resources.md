# Azure Resources

Resource is the basic building block of Azure. Anything you create, provision, deploy, etc. is a resource. Virtual Machines (VMs), virtual networks, databases, cognitive services, etc. are all considered resources within Azure.


### Azure Resource Groups

Resource groups are simply groupings of resources. When you create a resource, youâ€™re required to place it into a resource group. Resource groups are resources themselves, still there is no nesting of resource groups (we cannot have a resource group inside a resource group).

- A **logical container** for organizing resources.
- Useful for **lifecycle management**, **access control**, **cost tracking**, and **policy application**.
