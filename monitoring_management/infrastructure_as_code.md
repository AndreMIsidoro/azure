# Infrastructure as code

Infrastructure as code is a concept where you manage your infrastructure as lines of code. At an introductory level, it's things like using Azure Cloud Shell, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure CLI to manage and configure your resources. As you get more comfortable in the cloud, you can use the infrastructure as code concept to manage entire deployments using repeatable templates and configurations. ARM templates and Bicep are two examples of using infrastructure as code with the Azure Resource Manager to maintain your environment.
