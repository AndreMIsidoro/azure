# Bicep

Bicep is a language that uses declarative syntax to deploy Azure resources. A Bicep file defines the infrastructure and configuration. Then, ARM deploys that environment based on your Bicep file. While similar to an ARM template, which is written in JSON, Bicep files tend to use a simpler, more concise style.
