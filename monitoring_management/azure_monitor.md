# Azure Monitor

Azure Monitor is a platform for collecting data on your resources, analyzing that data, visualizing the information, and even acting on the results. Azure Monitor can monitor Azure resources, your on-premises resources, and even multi-cloud resources like virtual machines hosted with a different cloud provider.


## Azure Monitor Alerts

Azure Monitor Alerts are an automated way to stay informed when Azure Monitor detects a threshold being crossed. You set the alert conditions, the notification actions, and then Azure Monitor Alerts notifies when an alert is triggered. Depending on your configuration, Azure Monitor Alerts can also attempt corrective action.
