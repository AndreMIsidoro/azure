# Azure Tables

Azure Table storage stores large amounts of structured data. Azure tables are a NoSQL datastore that accepts authenticated calls from inside and outside the Azure cloud. This enables you to use Azure tables to build your hybrid or multicloud solution and have your data always available. Azure tables are ideal for storing structured, non-relational data.
