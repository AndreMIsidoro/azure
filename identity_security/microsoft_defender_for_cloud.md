# Microsoft Defender for Cloud

Defender for Cloud is a monitoring tool for security posture management and threat protection. It monitors your cloud, on-premises, hybrid, and multicloud environments to provide guidance and notifications aimed at strengthening your security posture.

Because Defender for Cloud is an Azure-native service, many Azure services are monitored and protected without needing any deployment. However, if you also have an on-premises datacenter or are also operating in another cloud environment, monitoring of Azure services may not give you a complete picture of your security situation

In addition to defending your Azure environment, you can add Defender for Cloud capabilities to your hybrid cloud environment to protect your non-Azure servers. To help you focus on what matters the most, you'll get customized threat intelligence and prioritized alerts according to your specific environment.

Defender for Cloud can also protect resources in other clouds (such as AWS and GCP).

One of the benefits of moving to the cloud is the ability to grow and scale as you need, adding new services and resources as necessary. Defender for Cloud is constantly monitoring for new resources being deployed across your workloads. Defender for Cloud assesses if new resources are configured according to security best practices. If not, they're flagged and you get a prioritized list of recommendations for what you need to fix. Recommendations help you reduce the attack surface across each of your resources.
