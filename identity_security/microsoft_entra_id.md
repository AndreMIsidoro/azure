# Microsoft Entra ID

Microsoft Entra ID is a directory service that enables you to sign in and access both Microsoft cloud applications and cloud applications that you develop. Microsoft Entra ID can also help you maintain your on-premises Active Directory deployment.

For on-premises environments, Active Directory running on Windows Server provides an identity and access management service that's managed by your organization. Microsoft Entra ID is Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management service. With Microsoft Entra ID, you control the identity accounts, but Microsoft ensures that the service is available globally. If you've worked with Active Directory, Microsoft Entra ID will be familiar to you.

One method of connecting Microsoft Entra ID with your on-premises AD is using Microsoft Entra Connect.
