# Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)

When you have multiple IT and engineering teams, how can you control what access they have to the resources in your cloud environment? The principle of least privilege says you should only grant access up to the level needed to complete a task. If you only need read access to a storage blob, then you should only be granted read access to that storage blob. Write access to that blob shouldn’t be granted, nor should read access to other storage blobs. It’s a good security practice to follow.

However, managing that level of permissions for an entire team would become tedious. Instead of defining the detailed access requirements for each individual, and then updating access requirements when new resources are created or new people join the team, Azure enables you to control access through Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC).

Role-based access control is applied to a scope, which is a resource or set of resources that this access applies to.

Scopes include:

- A management group (a collection of multiple subscriptions).
- A single subscription.
- A resource group.
- A single resource.
Azure RBAC is hierarchical, in that when you grant access at a parent scope, those permissions are inherited by all child scopes.

Azure RBAC is enforced on any action that's initiated against an Azure resource that passes through Azure Resource Manager. Resource Manager is a management service that provides a way to organize and secure your cloud resources.

You typically access Resource Manager from the Azure portal, Azure Cloud Shell, Azure PowerShell, and the Azure CLI. Azure RBAC doesn't enforce access permissions at the application or data level. Application security must be handled by your application.
