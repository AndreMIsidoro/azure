# Azure External Identities

An external identity is a person, device, service, etc. that is outside your organization. Microsoft Entra External ID refers to all the ways you can securely interact with users outside of your organization.

External identities may sound similar to single sign-on. With External Identities, external users can "bring their own identities." Whether they have a corporate or government-issued digital identity, or an unmanaged social identity like Google or Facebook, they can use their own credentials to sign in.
