# Zero Trust Model

Microsoft highly recommends the Zero Trust security model, which is based on these guiding principles:

- **Verify explicitly** - Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points.
- **Use least privilege access** - Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection.
- **Assume breach** - Minimize blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption. Use analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defenses.
