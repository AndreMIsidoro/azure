# Azure Containers Apps

Azure Container Apps are similar in many ways to a container instance. They allow you to get up and running right away, they remove the container management piece, and they're a PaaS offering. Container Apps have extra benefits such as the ability to incorporate load balancing and scaling. These other functions allow you to be more elastic in your design.
