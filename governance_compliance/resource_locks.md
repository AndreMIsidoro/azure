# Resource Locks

A resource lock prevents resources from being accidentally deleted or changed. Even with Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) policies in place, there's still a risk that people with the right level of access could delete critical cloud resources. Resource locks prevent resources from being deleted or updated, depending on the type of lock.
