# Azure Policy

Azure Policy is primarily focused on **enforcing rules** and **regulations** that govern how Azure resources are deployed and managed.

Azure Policy enables you to define both individual policies and groups of related policies, known as initiatives. Azure Policy evaluates your resources and highlights resources that aren't compliant with the policies you've created. Azure Policy can also prevent noncompliant resources from being created.

Azure Policies can be set at each level, enabling you to set policies on a specific resource, resource group, subscription, and so on. Additionally, Azure Policies are inherited, so if you set a policy at a high level, it will automatically be applied to all of the groupings that fall within the parent.

**Azure Policy** is specifically designed to **track and enforce compliance** with organizational policies across Azure resources. It enables you to define policies for resource deployment and ensure that they meet specific compliance standards.
